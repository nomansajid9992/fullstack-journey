        The
        <hr> tag in HTML is used to create a horizontal line on a webpage. It represents a thematic break or separation
        between content, such as between different topics or sections.

        The
        <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means it does not need a closing tag. It is mainly used to visually divide
        content and make the webpage more organized and easier to read.
