        The paragraph tag in HTML is used to write a paragraph of text on a webpage. Anything written between these tags will appear as a separate paragraph in the browser.
        The paragraph tag automatically adds some space before and after the text, which makes the content look clean and
        easy to read. It is mainly used to organize written content into proper paragraphs on a webpage.
