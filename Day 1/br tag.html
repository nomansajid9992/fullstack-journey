        The <br> tag in HTML is used to insert a line break in text. It moves the content to the next line without
        starting a new paragraph. Unlike the paragraph tag, it does not add extra space; it simply breaks the line.

        The <br> tag is an empty tag, so it does not need a closing tag. It is commonly used in poems, addresses, or
        anywhere you need a single line break.
