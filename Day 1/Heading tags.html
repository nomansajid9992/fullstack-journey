        Heading tags in HTML are used to define titles and subtitles on a webpage. They range from
    <h1> to <h6>, where <h1> represents the main and most important heading, and <h6> represents the smallest heading.
                    These tags help organize the content in a clear structure, making it easier for users to read and
                    understand the information. Heading tags also improve search engine optimization (SEO) by helping
                    search engines understand the main topics of a page, and they improve accessibility for screen
                    readers.
